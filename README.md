## multicell-sims
This contains the source code for the poster "Role of Intercellular Interactions on Single Cell and Population Level Responses: Considerations for Multicellular Bioreporter Design" published at RSGDREAM24 at https://iscb.junolive.co/rsgdream/live/exhibitor/rsgdream2024_poster_54
Notebooks and scripts to parse Virtual Cell VCML files and run multicellular simulations on them using the Giellspie algorithm. Implemented in python using `numpy` and `numba` with plots from `matplotlib`

`kinetics2.ipynb` contains the majority of the code use to generate the data presented.
Detailed applications of its usage can be found in the paper by the same name when it is published as conference proceedings in Bioinformatics.
